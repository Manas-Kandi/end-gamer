# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a neural network-based chess engine specialized in king-pawn endgames using self-play reinforcement learning based on AlphaZero methodology. The system will learn optimal play in these fundamental chess positions without requiring extensive human-crafted knowledge, achieving expert-level performance (1800+ Elo) while creating a scalable framework for extending to other endgames.

King-pawn endgames, despite involving only three pieces, contain rich strategic concepts including opposition, key squares, zugzwang, and triangulation. This project will use reinforcement learning to discover these principles through self-play rather than relying on traditional endgame tablebases.
