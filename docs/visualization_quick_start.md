## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting

```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart backend
cd api && python server.py
```

### Frontend Not Loading

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### WebSocket Not Connecting

1. Check backend is running: `http://localhost:8000`
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify firewall isn't blocking connections
4. Try refreshing the page

### Board Not Rendering

1. Ensure `react-chessboard` is installed:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install react-chessboard chess.js
   ```
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart frontend

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Game History)

- `‚Üê` Previous move
- `‚Üí` Next move
- `Home` First move
- `End` Last move

### Performance Tips

1. **Reduce chart data points** if dashboard is slow
2. **Close unused tabs** to save resources
3. **Use Chrome/Edge** for best performance
4. **Limit game history** to recent 1000 games

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Quick Test** to verify setup
2. **Monitor first few games** to ensure training works
3. **Check metrics regularly** to track progress
4. **Save checkpoints frequently** (automatic every 5K games)
5. **Use full training** only when ready for production

## Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d
